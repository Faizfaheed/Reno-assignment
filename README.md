## Deployment Notes
- The hosted demo on Vercel runs in **read-only mode**:
  - `READ_ONLY=true`  
  - Users **cannot add schools** or upload images.  
  - Existing schools (seeded locally) are visible and searchable.  
- **Full functionality** (Add School with image upload) works **locally only** due to Vercelâ€™s read-only filesystem.
