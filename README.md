## Deployment Notes
- The hosted demo runs in **read-only mode** on Vercel (`READ_ONLY=true`).  
  Uploads are disabled because Vercelâ€™s runtime file system is read-only.  
  To test uploads, run locally.

## Local Setup
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local  # or create .env.local with DB_*
docker-compose up -d
npm install
npm run dev
